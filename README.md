## Background
Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness worldwide, accounting for 51% of global cases according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Despite the importance of timely screening, traditional methods require specialized equipment and trained professionals, making them inaccessible to many in low-resource or remote areas.

Catascan addresses this gap by leveraging advancements in machine learning and mobile technology to develop a portable and affordable solution for cataract detection.

---

## Motivation
Our team was inspired by the significant global impact of cataracts on vision loss and the challenges faced by underserved communities in accessing traditional screening methods. By combining smartphone technology with AI, we aim to bridge this gap and contribute to the fight against preventable blindness.
